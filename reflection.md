What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?

I already had a pretty good understanding of the box model from previous experience, but I got practice setting margins for sizing and positioning.

What did you learn about CSS positioning?

I spent the most amount of time learning positioning this week.  I probably spent too much time on this because I feel I could have made better design choices but ran short on time.
The biggest thing I learned was about absolute and relative position in particuluar, as well as how to experiment with positioning by using DevTools.  DevTools is going to be my savior.

What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?

The easiest was applying styles such as color, background and fonts. The hardest was still positioning, but I learned more about it and tools to help perfect it.

What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?

I learned the most about selectors and how CSS chooses what styles to use on elements.  I didn't know that the order you link the stylesheets in the HTML would affect what styles were applied.
