      <h2>Enumerable Methods: group_by</h2>
      <p>I did research on the group_by method, because it seems very interesting in the fact that it takes an array and returns a hash. The basic idea is that you call group_by on an array, and then give a block by which you will be grouping the objects in the array.</p>
      <p>This sounds relatively easy, so for example if you had an array of all of the integers 1 to 100, you could <code>.group_by { |i| i %5 }</code> and this will return a hash with 5 different keys. The 5 keys will be the numbers 0 through 4, and the values for the keys will be arrays for all of the numbers that when divided by 5, give that remainder.</p>
      <p>You could also use this method on a list of strings.  By calling <code>.group_by</code> on a list of people and then passing the block <code>{ |l| l[0] }</code> the resulting hash will be broken up by first letter in the peoples' names.</p>
      <p>There are many different instances when you might want to take a list and group then in some way, and the <code>group_by</code> method gives you an easy way to do that, as long as you can put your grouping into a code block.</p>
