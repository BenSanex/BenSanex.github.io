      <h2>Arrays and Hashes</h2>
      <p>Ruby is a programming language with a lot of flexibility and room for customization.  There are many different ways you can store and manipulate data, and you can even create your own ways. Due to the commonality of needing to create lists, there are 2 pre created data types in Ruby that are very common and very useful: Arrays, and Hashes.</p>
      <p>Arrays and Hashes are very similiar, but have different uses and implementations. They both are a collection of data or objects (they can even be contain other arrays or hashes, or you can have an array of hashes or a hash containing arrays).  In its simplest form, an array is a just a list. An array of the members of ones' family could be <code> family = ["Tom", "Gail", "Kristen"]</code>. As you can see, its simply a list of the members of a theoretical familiy.</p>
      <p>This could be useful, but it doesn't really tell us anything about who they are, just that they exist.  If you wanted to give the members of the family, and who they were, you could use a hash.
      <code> family = { "Dad" => "Tom", "Mom" => "Gail", "Sister" => "Kristen"}</code>
      Now we know who all the family members are! In this case, the "Key" is what member of the family they are, Dad, Mom, Sister.  The "Value" is their name.</p>
      <p>Arrays and Hashes both have their uses. A grocery list would probably be better suited to an array. In the example above, a list of the members of a family, or a dictionary would be better suited to a hash.  It all depends on what type of data you're storing and what type of meaning it has. If you're working with data most easily recalled through a numbered list, then an Array is your friend.  If you need to give your data meaning, a Hash is the way to go.</p>
