      <h2>Looping in JavaScript</h2>
      <h5>(and I miss Ruby)

      <p>Looping as a concept is very important in any programming language.  One of the points of programming is making tasks easier, and having to type something out over and over again is not easier.  Both Ruby and JavaScript have multiple methods avaiable for looping, and I'll take a look at how JavaScript handles looping and compare that to Ruby equivalents.</p>
      <p>One of the most common loops in JavaScript is the <code>For</code> loop.  In JavaScript the loop is executed by defining a counter, how the counter breaks the loop and how the counter is incremented.  You then pass in the code block you want to repeat.  This is somewhat simliar to Ruby as you declare a counter type of variable and the block of code that it will evaluate through.  Both of these have very simliar uses like looping through an array, and differ mostly in syntax.</p>
      <p>The next loop in JavaScript is <code>For/In</code>.  This code looks more like a Ruby <code>For</code> loop, but really behaves more like <code>each</code>.  For EACH item in a dataset, the loop performs whatever is passed in the code block.  So although it looks like a Ruby For, it is more easily used as each, but is less common altogether.</p>
      <p>JavaScript while loop is probably the most like its Ruby equivalent.  While an expression is true, a code block is looped, which is about exactly the same as Ruby, only differeing in syntax. JavaScript also has a do/while loop which is just like putting the while after the code block in Ruby.</p>
      <p>Both JavaScript and Ruby have a number of methods to loop, and the two biggest differences are the syntax, and the fact that Ruby has way more options.</p>
