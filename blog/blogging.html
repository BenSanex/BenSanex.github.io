      <h2>Blog Post about Blog Posts</h2>
      <p>Blogging in general is a pretty new concept to me.  I was never terribly interested in reading other peoples' blogs, and definitely not interested in sharing my own feelings on my own blog.  Making this has been an eye opening experience. It feels good to reflect, and even if nobody ever reads my posts, I'm glad I posted them. In fact I might even feel more comfortable if I don't know if anybody ever does read them!</p>
      <p>Building my first website has been a challenge. I tried before on my own without formal training or any real structure. I tried right away to use Bootstrap and I think that hindered my ability to write and edit the website.  Doing it over I'm glad I started simple and built it up from there.  I now have realized the concept that I wanted to originally design, and it looks better than I have hoped.</p>
      <p>My biggest challenge by far is design. I'm not a creative design type, so choosing color schemes that looks good is really hard for me.  The original design on the webstie was so bright and colorful I think it may have blinded some of my friends. I went back and redisigned it to be simpler and more focused on content, but I still think it looks kind of ugly. I'm nervous that once I graduate this could affect my ability to get a job...</p>
