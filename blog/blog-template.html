How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?

It was great to be able to get inspiration from someone else, I also tried a wireframing tool that I hadn't used before which was extremely helpful.

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?

Even if I didn't wirefame on paper I would have had a wireframe in my mind. I think it is a necessary step 

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe? 

The most important thing is getting down what you want to have on the site so you know all the things to add.

What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?

My pair used a table to make his nav bar, so we both learned how to lay that out as a 1 row table with multple columns using <tr> and <td>. I've also been using <section> now that I've read about it, but I don't think that is a "semantic" element.
