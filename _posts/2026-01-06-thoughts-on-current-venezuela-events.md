  Personal reflections on the latest headlines from Caracas and what they mean for family on the ground.

With Venezuela all over the headlines, I thought it would be good to put my thoughts out into the ether. I realize I never finished my series documenting my trip, so I will write something to cover the rest of it, but that's going to take time to sift through pictures and memories.

Usually I consider myself libertarian: don't bother me, I don't bother you, and we all get along. I opposed going into Iraq under George W., thought Afghanistan was a boondoggle but at least somewhat justified given 9/11, and sit generally uncomfortable with the situation in Ukraine given we stand opposed to Russia in the conflict. Conflictingly, we are the United States, as parodied in Team America. We are supposed to be the good guys standing up for freedom globally and helping the oppressed, like when we stood against Hitler, communism, slavery, etc. Our record in South America is much less clear.

It's easy to say "just don't get involved." It's even easy to do: save money, save American lives.

But the world moves on around us even if we stay isolated. Bad actors can gain power and eventually those effects are felt in a variety of ways.

Venezuelans are in a tough position. The leadership ignores or falsifies election results, suppresses opposing voices, selectively enforces laws, pays people to do nothing, lets the infrastructure crumble, funds itself with drugs and other black-market activities, and treats businesses with mafia-like protection schemes. I could go on. Meanwhile, it is a beautiful country with a very large entrepreneurial, spirited population. But with no guns, and no way to *really* fight for their freedom, they're stuck. So how do they get out without foreign intervention?

Ousting the Chavista regime helps the US in multiple ways. Trump said "oil" about 100 times in his press conference, so that part is obvious and probably even overstated. The oil infrastructure is crumbling; the refinery we drove by was literally _on fire_. (I know they flare off gas sometimes. This was like a black-smoke, burning pit on fire.)

China has repeatedly signaled their intent to annex Taiwan, likely by the end of 2027. We have previously stated we support Taiwan's independence, but if it comes to military conflict with China, we do not want a Chinese-friendly autocrat so close by. Maduro is also cozy with Russia. I have seen multiple reports of Russian Tu-160 bombers being stationed in Venezuela. Meanwhile we're heavily supporting Ukraine against Russia in a conflict that seems to be no closer to ending than when it started. Getting rid of this threat in our hemisphere is, in the long term, probably a safe move. In addition, any future sanctions would carry that much more force if they were no longer able to sell the black-market oil.

Lastly, the Venezuelan exodus has sparked intense debate about our immigration policy over the last four years. It got to the point where people were literally walking through some of the most dangerous rainforest in the world, thousands of miles to get to the US border and then claiming asylum, essentially breaking the system. It was not designed to handle that volume of people. Now we've got Nazi thugs on the streets rounding up random brown people and throwing them in cages. While it's a bit of a chicken-and-egg problem, if we can improve life in their home country it would severely lower the demand on our immigration system.

In summary, we:

- remove a geopolitical problem within missile's reach of the Gulf Coast,
- potentially increase the global supply of oil,
- ease the demands on our immigration system, and
- lower the flow of illegal drugs.

Selfishly these are all fine, but even better, we help the majority of the people who just want their country back to its glory days. It sounds like a win-win to me. The most questionable thing about it all in my mind was the way force was used without the approval of Congress, but if Congress would just come around to supporting it in the first place then what question remains?
