      <p>I haven't written some basic HTML in ages, but I think its more important at this point to start posting than to worry about implementing some framework.</p>
      <p>Last week I attended THAT conference in Wisocnsin Dells. The day 2 keynote was given by Taylor Desseyn from gun.io. Part of his talk focused on the struggles that people like me can go through. It is very easy to feel alone. Especially after transitioning to remote work. Starting a family introduces a lot of routine and its easy to breeze through taking my family for granted and losing conneciton with coworkers and friends.
        One of his points was to start creating content.  The big note I kept says "Stop being a lurker". This blog hopefully will serve a few purposes.
        <ul>
            <li>Serve as an outlet for my thoughts</li>
            <li>Share knowledge to help contribute to the community</li>
            <li>Connect with others who may stumble upon this content</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I had greater inspiration to get things down here last week but as time passes I forget some of the things I wanted to talk about.
            In the near term I hope to accomplish two things. First I need to update this site so I'm not just copy pasting raw html over and over and updating links with new posts, its 2023.
            Secondly I need to post more often with some decent content.
