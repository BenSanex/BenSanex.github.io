    <h3>About Ben</h3>
      <p>I am an aspiring software developer from the suburbs of Chicago, IL. I have spent the last 7 years in different sales jobs, and am now pursuing my dreams of writing code.</p>
      <p>I graduated from NIU with a degree in Marketing in 2009. Since then I have worked for various companies in the Chicagoland area, and for over 5 of the years since college I have held a multitude of positions for Verizon Wireless in retail stores.</p>
      <p>I spend most of my free time with my dog and my girlfriend, enjoying life in downtown Chicago (especially the food).  When we're not trying to get a table at the hottest new restaurants in Chicago, I spend most of my time either learning code, cooking or following my favorite eSports teams.</p>
